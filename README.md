# Creating a Private, Permissioned Avalanche Subnet (for Health Data Management)

## Introduction

Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche is the first decentralized smart contracts platform built for the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction finality. Avalanche is a blockchain that promises to combine scaling capabilities and quick confirmation times through its Avalanche Consensus Protocol. It can process 4,500 TPS (transactions per second). For Ethereum, that number is 14 TPS.

Blockchains have traditionally been referred to as being slow and unscalable. Avalanche embraces an innovative approach to concensus that solve these problems without compromising on security.

Avalanche is a high-performance, scalable, customizable, and secure blockchain platform. It targets three 15 broad use cases:

* Building application-specific blockchains, spanning permissioned (private) and permissionless (public)
deployments.
* Building and launching highly scalable and decentralized applications (Dapps).
* Building arbitrarily complex digital assets with custom rules, covenants, and riders (smart assets).

# Avalanche features 3 built-in blockchains: 
* Exchange Chain (X-Chain)
* Platform Chain (P-Chain)
* Contract Chain (C-Chain)

The P-chain is for platform management. It handles requests related to the validator, the subnet, and the blockchain. 
The C-chain is for contract management. It is based on EVM; hence its API is almost identical to other EVM protocols. It has both RPC and WebSocket endpoints, and it handles requests for smart contracts. 
The X-chain is for asset exchange. It is Avalancheâ€™s native platform; it is used for creating and trading assets like AVAX and NFTs. 

These 3 blockchains are secured by the Avalanche Primary Network with is a special kind of subnet.

The Avalanche Architecture is composed of:
* Subnetworks
* Virtual Machines


The goal of this guide is to lay out best practices regarding setting up Private and Permissioned Avalanche's Subnet with the following levels of privace:
* Control of validator requirements
* Control of contract deployment
* Private transaction posting
* Private transaction reading


## Subnetworks
A subnet is defined as a set of validators working together to achieve a certain concensus on the state of a blockchain. Each blockchain is validated by one subnet, and a subnet can validate arbitrarily many blockchains.
Subnets have various advantages which include:
* Subnets can specify rules for members joining them, this is achieved via creating private subnets. This enables the blockchain to be governed only be a group of trusted validators.
* With this model, one can create subnets with various properties. For example, only allowing members from a certain jurisdiction or goegraphical location.
* With this model, one can create subnets with various properties. For example:
    * Validators must be located in a given country
    * Validators must pass a KYC/AML checks
    * Validators must hold a certain license

## Private Subnets for Managing Healthcare Data
The challenges and risks related to centralized health records can be basically summarised as vulnerablity and access management difficulties. Various bodies has studied and fully comprehened the risks involved in data loss in [centralised systems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068075/). 
Among other things, this conclusion led the US Department of Defense to create in 1969 the ARPANET, a network system that would be able to remain functional in case of a catastrophe. Regarding health data, the same approach can be applied and it would be obviously much safer to store such data in a decentralised permissioned fashion to ensure the protection of information, as it could be, for example, a target for terrorists who wish to destabilize a country by destroying or by pirating its health system and by divulging health information on citizens. Furthermore, hackers may see a centralized system as a challenge and try to gain access to a centralized patient EMR system and modify patients' medical information.

## Prerequisites

### NodeJS and Yarn

First, install the LTS (long-term support) version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en). This is `16.2.0` at the time of writing. NodeJS bundles `npm`.

Next, install the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) package manager:

```zsh
npm install -g yarn
```

### Git

To check the current Git version use:

```zsh
git --version
```


# Roadmap

This tutorial is created to serve as a guide to enable developers create fully customizable Avalanche subnets. For the purpose of this tutorial, all testing will be done on the Local and Fiji testnet. This guide is an extension of the [Official Avalanche Documentation]().

We will be creating a blockchain network specific for managing healthcare data and transactions. This network would have the ablity to regulate it validator requirements and ensure a certain degree of privacy as if necessary for managing sensitive data.

Please note that all command line inputs and sample codes are MacOs and Linux Based. Commands may vary for other operating systems.

In summary, we will be discussing the following:
1. Running an EVM Subnet on the Local Network using the default configuration
2. Restricting Smart Contract Deployment, Transaction and making our Subnet Private on the Local Network
3. Private Transaction Posting and Reading



# 1. Running an EVM Subnet on the Local Network using the default configuration <a name="local"></a>

We will be creating an EVM on our local machine to give us a basic feel on how a subnet functions. The [Avalanche-CLI](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli) is a novel tool that allow up to have a local network up in minutes.


## Step 1: Installation

Open up you MacOs command line utility and run the following command

On your home directory, create a new and `cd <newdir>` into the directory. This is where we will be installing all our project dependencies.

```zsh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
```

This command download the latest binary of the [Avalanche-cli] to the current directory where it was executed.

`cd` into the `bin` folder and export the path variable

```zsh
cd bin
export PATH=$PWD:PATH
```

This makes the `avalanche` command available globally. For more information about [environment-variables]() and [avalanche-cli-commands]() visit the respective links.

![variables](/images/cover.jpeg "variables")


## Set 2: Initilizing a default subnet

We will be using the `avalanche subnet create` command line wizard to get our network running. STAT.
In the same directory where the binary was installed, run the following command

```zsh
avalanche subnet create <subnetName>
```
Substitute `<subnetName>` with any perferred name of your choice but without spaces. For this tutorial we are going to call our subnet `<fibrinNet>`.

```zsh
avalanche subnet create fibrinNet
```

Since this command does not provide any arguements, you would neeed to walk through the configuration wizard to generate a genesis file for your network.

* Choose a VM: 
  ![choose a VM](/images/2.png "Choose VM")
  We are going to be making use of the `SubnetEVM`

* Pick a chain ID
  ![chain ID](/images/3.png "Chain ID")
  Every EVM based blockchain has a special parameter called a `chainID`. ChainIDs are expected to be unique values, you can check [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/) to see if your proposed chain ID is already in use. We will be making use of the chain ID `1970` (A pun on JavaScript dates...lol).

* Select a symbol for the native subnet token
  ![symbol](/images/4.png "token symbol")

* Set fees: Select the `low disk use / low throughput` option
  ![fees](/images/5.png "fees")

* Airdrop: default to airdrop 1 million tokens to provided address
  ![airdrop](/images/6.png "airdrop")

* Add a custom precompile to modify the EVM: For this section, we will not be using a pre-compile script
  ![precompile](/images/7.png "precompile")


The wizard won't customize every aspect of the Subnet-EVM genesis for you, we will be doing this in the subsequent sections.

![complete](/images/8.png "complete")

To view the list of all created subnets, just execute the following command

```zsh
avalanche subnet list
```
![list](/images/9.png "list")


## Step 3: Deploying the Subnet Locally.

To deploy the newly created subnet locally, run the following command

```zsh
avalanche subnet deploy <subnetName>
```

![deploy](/images/10.png "deploy")

When a subnet is run locally, it starts a multi-node Avalanche Network in the background.

![deploy_f](/images/11.png "deploy_f")

To test the functionality of the just created subnet, go ahead and add the configuration details to [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).
You can create a new metamask account by importing the private key `0x56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027` and start experiencing with this account.

Lastly don't forget to stop the running local network
```zsh
avalanche network stop <snapshotName>
```

![deploy_f](/images/12.png "deploy_f")


For detailed instructions on how to set-up the new RPC network to work with metamask, visit the Avalanche [Documentation](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-your-evm#step-1-setting-up-metamask)

![metamask](/images/metamask.png "metamask")


## Step 4: Deploying a Test Smart Contract on the Subnet.

From your preferred web browser, navigate to the [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) Platform.
We will be importing a sample solidity code from a this github repository.

From the remix home page, select the `Load from github` option.

![github](/images/15.png "github")

In the dialogue box, paste the following link.
```zsh
https://github.com/FibrinLab/Avalanche-Private-Permissioned-Subnets/blob/main/src/medical_records.sol
```

On the Remix Menu, select the `compile` tab and compile the `medical_records` smart contract using the appropriate solidity compiler version. Remix im most cases automatically detects the suitable compiler version for your project.

![compile](/images/16.png "compile")

Next, select the Deploy tab and choose the `Injected Web3` from the dropdown. This option allows you to make use you newly created network rather that a simulated environment provided for you by Remix.

![compile](/images/17.png "compile")

Select the correct prefunded account and Deploy the smart contract.

![compile](/images/18.png "compile")

Hooray... lol. You just deployed your first smart contract for managing Health related transcations on a Subnet you created.
We would subsequently be customising this subnet to achieve varying levels of privacy.

![final](/images/19.png "final")


# 2. Restricting Smart Contract Deployment, Transaction and making our Subnet Private on the Local Network

In this section we are going to set some rules for our Local Subnet by Restricting Smart contract deployments to certain addresses. This function is quite essestial especially in the field of decentralized health. Imagine you have a private permissioned blockchain for a group of health providers, it would be quite essential to specify the role associated to various addresses to ensure the strictest data security and data privacy.

In order to achieve this, we will be specifying our own `genesis file` to be used with the `Avalanche-cli`.

The `genesis file` we will be making use of is located at:

```zsh
https://github.com/FibrinLab/Avalanche-Private-Permissioned-Subnets/blob/main/networks/genesis.json
```

Let carefully examine our `Genesis File`.
The genesis file specifies the initial state of the Virtual Machine with it is created. In trying to implement restrictions towards deploying smart contracts, there are certain parameters we will be taking a closer look at. They include:
* `contractDeployerAllowListConfig` and
* `txAllowListConfig`


In order to put this into practice, we are going to create a `Local Avalance Subnet` for a group of hospitals where only the `Administrator` is allowed to deploy smart contracts. We will also see how to add other `Hospital Admins` to the allowed addresses to deploy contracts. Awesome, lets get started.

## Step 1

Lets have a look at our `genesis file`. The genesis file is usually in JSON format and passed as a parameter with initializing the `Avalanche-cli`.

```zsh
"contractDeployerAllowListConfig": {
        "blockTimestamp": 0,
        "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
},
```

From the above code the `adminAddress` is set to `0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC`. This address has the ability to add other address that can also deploy contracts.

```zsh
"alloc": {
      "8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC": {
        "balance": "0x84595161401484A000000"
      }
},
```

The `alloc` defines addresses and their intial balances. Here we airdrop `50million` tokens to the admin address. `84595161401484A000000` is in hexidecimal, you can make use of a [converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html) to get the decimal equivalent.

Great, Its time to get our `Custom EVM subnet` running.

## Step 2

Navigate to your project directory and run the following command.

```zsh
avalanche subnet create [subnetName] --file <pathToGenesis>
```

Notice how we use the --file flag to specify a path to the `Genesis file`.

![gen1](/images/22.png "gen1")

Select the `SubnetEVM` Virtual machine

![gen2](/images/23.png "gen2")

Great you have sucessfully created a genesis.

You can verify this by running the following command

```zsh
avalanche subnet list
```

![gen3](/images/24.png "gen3")

Its now time to deploy. Go ahead and run the following command

```zsh
avalanche subnet deploy <subnetName>
```

![gen4](/images/25.png "gen4")

We go our subnet deployed and running locally.

### Step 3

Go ahead and add the `RPC` credentials to metamask. 
For detailed instructions on how to set-up the new RPC network to work with metamask, visit the Avalanche [Documentation](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-your-evm#step-1-setting-up-metamask)


Create a new `Wallet Account` and fund it with some `TEST` tokens.

![meta1](/images/26.png "meta1")

![meta2](/images/27.png "meta2")

From your preferred web browser, navigate to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
We will be importing the same `medical records` smart contract used earlier.

From the remix home page, select the `Load from github` option.

![github](/images/15.png "github")

In the dialogue box, paste the following link.
```zsh
https://github.com/FibrinLab/Avalanche-Private-Permissioned-Subnets/blob/main/src/medical_records.sol
```

On the Remix Menu, select the `compile` tab and compile the `medical_records` smart contract using the appropriate solidity compiler version. Remix im most cases automatically detects the suitable compiler version for your project.

![compile](/images/16.png "compile")

Next, select the Deploy tab and choose the `Injected Web3` from the dropdown. This option allows you to make use you newly created network rather that a simulated environment provided for you by Remix.

![compile](/images/17.png "compile")

Select the newly created account (not the default admin account) and Deploy the smart contract. Make sure the chain ID matches that of you subnet.

![deploy](/images/28.png "deploy")


Notice that you get an error saying ===>

```zsh
0x61106F1b252a0459D4c50AcC3382b6878005A535 is not authorized to deploy a contract
```

![deploy1](/images/29.png "deploy1")

We have sucessfully restricted contract deployment to only 1 address.


### Step 4

Not let add our newly created account to the `Allowed Contract Deployer` list. We accomplish this by importing the `AllowListInterface` into remix and executing some function calls from the `Admin` account. The interface is deployed at `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000`

Create a new solidity file (.sol) and paste the following code

```zsh
// (c) 2022-2023, Ava Labs, Inc. All rights reserved.
// See the file LICENSE for licensing terms.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

interface AllowListInterface {
    // Set [addr] to have the admin role over the allow list
    function setAdmin(address addr) external;

    // Set [addr] to be enabled on the allow list
    function setEnabled(address addr) external;

    // Set [addr] to have no role over the allow list
    function setNone(address addr) external;

    // Read the status of [addr]
    function readAllowList(address addr) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

The describes the available functions that can be called from the Admin account.
* setAdmin: This make the passed in address an `admin`
* setEnabled: Adds an account to the allowed `deployers` list

Compile the contract and navigate to the `Deploy` tab.

![deploy2](/images/30.png "deploy2")

Make sure `MetaMask` is switched to the `Admin` account.

Input the contract address `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000` and select `At Address`.

![deploy3](/images/31.png "deploy3")

This retrieves a deployed instance of the already deployed contract.

Paste the address of the `new` metamask account in the `setEnabled` field and call the function.

![deploy4](/images/32.png "deploy4")

Switch to the new metamask account and try deploying a smart contract.

![deploy5](/images/33.png "deploy5")

![deploy6](/images/34.png "deploy6")


Hoorayyyyyy. It works.


# Conclusion

We have sucessfully created our own customised EVM Subnet with various levels of restrictions. The applications of this configuration is endless when considering its potentials. We modified smart contract deployment permissions and made our subnet Private.

Feel free to fork and improve this repo.
