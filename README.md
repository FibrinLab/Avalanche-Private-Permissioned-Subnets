# Creating a Private, Permissioned Avalanche Subnet (for Health Data Management)

## Introduction

Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche is the first decentralized smart contracts platform built for the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction finality. 

Blockchains have traditionally been referred to as being slow and unscalable. Avalanche embraces an innovative approach to concensus that solve these problems without compromising on security.

Avalanche is a high-performance, scalable, customizable, and secure blockchain platform. It targets three
15 broad use cases:

* Building application-specific blockchains, spanning permissioned (private) and permissionless (public)
deployments.
* Building and launching highly scalable and decentralized applications (Dapps).
* Building arbitrarily complex digital assets with custom rules, covenants, and riders (smart assets).

Avalanche features 3 built-in blockchains: 
* Exchange Chain (X-Chain)
* Platform Chain (P-Chain)
* Contract Chain (C-Chain)

These 3 blockchains are secured by the Avalanche Primary Network with is a special kind of subnet.

The Avalanche Architecture is composed of:
* Subnetworks
* Virtual Machines
